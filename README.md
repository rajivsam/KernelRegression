# KernelRegression
Kernel Regression example
These examples illustrate kernel regression and kernel pca. Two multivariate regression datasets from the UCI repository were used for this demonstration. The examples illustrate the need for kernel regression by fitting a
traditional linear (in the predictors) model and contrasting the mean square error on a test dataset with kernel regression implementations from the KRLS and the kernlab package. The embedding of the original dataset in the kernelized space using kernel pca illustrates kernel pca - we see a linear fit in the kernelized space where as the data is not linear in the original space.
